In this essay, I will argue that motivation to do the right thing is not defective in cases where agents perform actions that they know to be right, but don’t know why it’s right. Primarily, I will examine the case of Huckleberry Finn, from Mark Twain’s book Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, a boy who helps an enslaved man escape from slavery while simultaneously believing that he is committing the heinous crime of infringing on a slave owner’s property rights. This ties strongly into our question of whether or not we should examine the motivations of people who do what’s right without knowing why, even though Huck specifically and repeatedly claims that what he is doing is bad because it is unlawful. Throughout the novel, Huck struggles with reconciling his desire to see his friend live freely with the desire to follow the property laws of his society. Clearly, he wants to do the right thing, and to his knowledge, the right thing to do is to follow the law.
